### Children Playfulness

Playfulness of children is usually a concern for most parents; a playful child is mostly translated to be a happy child. [@Guitard2005] defined playfulness as "an internal predisposition characterized by creativity, curiosity, pleasure, sense of humor, and spontaneity". The study of [@Rigby2007] examined the playfulness of children depending on their environment, it considered the context of home and school. [@Rigby2007] suggested that the playfulness of a child depended on the external factors of their environments that goes beyond the individual. The study of [@atara] suggested that the playfulness of the mother and father with the child has an impact on the child's negativity. [@Fabrizi2016] further considered the usefulness of playgroups in promoting playfulness among children. (@gwen) studied the effects of child playfulness on their adulthood lifestyles.

library(tidyverse)

messy <- data.frame(id = 1:4,
                    trt = sample(rep(c('control', 'treatment'), each = 2)),
                    work_T1 = runif(4),
                    home_T1 = runif(4),
                    work_T2 = runif(4),
                    home_T2 = runif(4))
messy
```

#### Data Type: The data is in "wide-format"

```{r, echo=TRUE}
messy_longer <- messy %>% pivot_longer(!c(id, trt), names_to = "location", values_to = "time_spent")

messy_longer
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
messy_longer %>% separate(location, c("location", "interval/times"))
